        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>We are a group of young wine professionals and lovers working in various independant wine venues around Dublin city. We might not seem old and wisened, like the wine gatekeepers of old, but we have over 50 years of collective experience in all matters wine; from supermarket wine buyers to Michelin starred Sommelliers! If you have bought a bottle of wine in Dublin over the last 10 years one of us has been involved.</p>

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>We offer an entry way into wine for anybody, regardless of background or tastes. We love wine and want to celebrate it and share it with as many people as possible. Because of this passion to share we wanted to create a friendly and accessible platform to learn and enjoy wine without all the farty nonesense.</p>

            <a href="school.html"><h3>School</h3></a>
            <p>
                Our wine school offers a variety of courses for all interest and knowledge levels. These events are molded around more traditional wine teachings and are therefore more objective in nature. Great for those looking to add some theory to their practical wine knowledge.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <a href="tastings.html"><h3>Tastings</h3></a>
            <p>
               Our tasting evenings are almost the complete oposite of our wine school events! While we still talk facts about the wines we drink, the tastings are designed to be much more relaxed and focused on subjective tasting and exploring the fun side of the vine.
