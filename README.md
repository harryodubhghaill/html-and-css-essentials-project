# Vineheads

Vineheads is a website that aims to make attending wine events as easy and approachable as possible. The site is targeted towards anyone with an interest in learning about and tasting wine. The site will outline who will run the events, how they will run and when they will run.

Users will be able to browse events, view past events and contact the business through the site.
